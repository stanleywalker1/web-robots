# web-robots

Autonomous array of robots, with a new robot spawning every 4 seconds. Toggle with the arrows to change the direction flow and gain points by leading the robots to the green door on the right side of the factory. This project displays OOP practice and techniques. Optimized to avoid excessive memory use. Built with p5.js for Interactive Computing @ NYU. Try to see if you can build a solution to reset robots that get stuck in an arrow loop in the factory (I didnâ€™t have enough time to implement this but understanding how to approach it is a good exercise).
